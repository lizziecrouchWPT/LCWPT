							<h1>I'm going to talk about me!</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/beforeafter.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p> I'm Lizzie and I found my love for fitness in November 2019, This interest increased over the lockdown period in March 2020 and since then has been something I have become very passionate about. I have managed to shift over 40lbs myself without any meal replacements or anything like that and I want to motivate others and help you start your journey by providing free workout plans which I have used myself, and continue to use most days.</p>
							<p>Theres always a turning point where one day it clicks and you are in the right mindset to make a lifestyle change, and mine happened just after my birthday a few years ago where I looked in the mirror and did not like what I could see. I remember at work people were talking about having a night out and I was already in my head coming up with excuses because I didn't want people to see my arms or to think I looked gross/fat/disgusting. The very next day I took a plunge and signed up for the gym, I was incredibly lucky that someone who I worked with also went to the gym so I had someone to go with, who could show me all the equipment and for few months we worked together and it was brilliant. But although I was exercising my weight was not shifting... </p>
							<p>So what was the problem? I was working out a lot but felt no changes. When people talk about diet being extremely important for weight loss they are not joking <b>AT ALL.</b> I started counting my calories and making sure I was eating better - more fruit and veg and less takeaways. And as if by magic the weight started to shift. It felt amazing to be losing it and I started to fall more and more in love with it.</p>
							<p>Fast forward to now where I'm writing my own plans and knowing what fuels my body. It's amazing how much you learn when you enjoy something. I'm so keen to know more about it and love watching videos of people doing different exercises all the time. I am hopeful that these free plans will inspire some people and help them start off on their fitness journey.</p>
